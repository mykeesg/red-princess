## FAQ

- ***Why are you not using [XYZ] framework instead?***
    - Because I want this to be as portable as possible. Playing the game should be as easy as opening the `index.html`
      in the browser, without requiring `npm install` or other stuff while taking up `500MB` for a `node_modules`
      folder.
- ***What is Blue Prince?***
    - A puzzle game based on rogue-like mechanics with some RNG and insane amount of depth in puzzles. Check it out
      on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1569580/Blue_Prince/).
